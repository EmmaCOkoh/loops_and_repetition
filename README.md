# Loops â€“ Teaching Python to Repeat!

Today, I learned how to make Python **repeat** things over and over using **loops**. Itâ€™s like teaching my code to be a robot! ðŸ¤–

---

## I Learned:

- How to use `for` loops to repeat things a set number of times
- How to use `while` loops to repeat while something is true
- How to count up, count down, and ask for input many times

---

## What I Practiced:

- Saying Hello multiple times
- Counting numbers and even numbers
- Asking for names and saying Hello
- Building a simple game with a secret password

---

## Portfolio Project:

I built a **Multiplication Table Generator** that:
- Asks the user for a number
- Prints that number's multiplication table from 1 to 12
